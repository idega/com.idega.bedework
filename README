Please don't use this now. It not works.

FOR DEVELOPERS:
First, you must copy/paste configurations of context.xml and <GlobalNamingResources> 
of server.xml into Tomcat/conf directory, otherwise JNDI and JMS won't work. Also, you 
should put web-inf/activemq.xml to your-app/web-inf/activemq.xml

Second, to get first exception of Bedework, you should add BedeworkPersonalCalendarView
component. If you get NotImplementedException for
"com.idega.bedework.data.BedeworkCalendarEntry.getLedgerID(BedeworkCalendarEntry.java:262)"
it means that something was done fine.

Third. Class BwAPI will give you handlers, which should be used for event managing, 
UserAdapter will help you manage users between idega and bedework one.
Examples of events and calendar creation should be visible on BwCalBussinessBean, but
still they are not tested, although they worker few times.

What is problematic but should be done:

1) Integrate timezone server - the one is used now: http://stable.bedework.org/tzsvr;
2) Fix efcache.xml usage, it seems it is not used now;
3) Exclude duplicates of jar files between bedework and idega systems;
4) Place content of context.xml to web.xml and server.xml to ROOT.xml;
5) Find way, that applicationContext.xml use activeMQ.xml in current /web-inf directory, 
but not in your-webapp/web-inf;
6) Move options.xml to web-inf;
7) Fix JmsConnectionHandler in way, that "sysevents" JMS Queue would be found from 
context, but not created dynamically. (at 94 row).

What is not so problematic:
1) Implement unimplemented methods in BwCalBussinessBean.
